# Logical Volume Manager (LVM) üíΩ
## Description

LVM is a logical volume manager for the Linux kernel that allows you to manage disk storage. 
It is a device mapper target that provides logical volume management for the Linux kernel.

LVM combines multiple physical disk drives into a single ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù drive (Volume group). 
This virtual drive can then be divided into one or more logical volumes. 
Each logical volume can be formatted with a filesystem and mounted as a separate drive.
